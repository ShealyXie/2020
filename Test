I wonder if I could come over all the difficulties in the research future, but the good thing is that I'm not an easy-giving-up person which is of great significance to my future.
Today I got that the sophomore student of THU in our lab ranked the first of Chongqing in 2017, so I should learn to live on with the fact that people in THU/PKU are really great both in their experience and ability which are bound to their family. 
So I should be feeling lucky to got the chance to be admitted to PKU.
Besides, I will struggle to make everything right and push myself further and further.
